# Model Initialization (get_general_parameters)

## General Parameters
c - speed of light
freqGPS - L1, L2 and L5 GPS frequencies
userInput.dateTime - Date
userInput.RXPos - Initial Receiver Position
userInput.RXVel = [100 0 0]';
userInput.PRN (For now, focus on using a single satellite)
userInput.plotSign;


## Irregularity parameters (put them all in a struct with the names 'Strong', 'Moderate', 'Mild')
U - Universal Turbulance Strength
\mu_0 - Normalized Break Wavenumber
p_1 - Low-frequency Spectral Index
p_2 - High-Frequency Spectral Index

Compute \rho_F / v_{eff} based on the propagation geometry *only*
(Considering different drift velocities)

Extrapolate the model parameters for L2 and L5.

# Scintillation Time Series Generation (get_split_step_time_series; Needs to be applied for each frequency band, ensuring the usage of a same rng seed.)

## get_phase_SDF (needs the values of the irregularity parameters and a array with the values for \mu.)

## get_phase_realization

## get_propagated_field

# Make the plots

* Single Satellite plots:
## Comparison between the the computed SDFs and decorrelation time using Charles Carrano C code and the periodogram of the realizations obtained for each frequency band.

## Amplitude and phase time series for each frequency band

** Multiple satellites and stations case (later)
## Plot the distribution of the values for the S4 and \tau_0 obtained for each:
- receiver position
- date
- satellite
- drift
- Rough strength class (Severe, Moderate and Mild)
